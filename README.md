# Page Ranking Project using Agent-Based Modelling

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the **PageRank algorithm** through **Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)**, which allows us to simulate the behavior and ranking process of web pages. The objective is to analyze how different factors, such as **page connections** and the **damping factor**, influence the rankings of pages in a network. Through this, we aim to gain insights into how PageRank operates in real-world scenarios and uncover future research opportunities.

## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital age, **PageRank algorithms** are essential for efficiently navigating the vast expanse of online information. **Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)** is used in this project to simulate the behavior of the algorithm and analyze how different parameters influence page rankings. This report explores these dynamics and identifies future research directions.

## Methodology

This project employs **Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)** to simulate the PageRank algorithm. The following steps were undertaken:
1. **Implementation of the PageRank algorithm** using ABM to simulate the behavior of web pages.
2. **Comparative analysis** between ABM results and actual PageRank outcomes.
3. Conducting experiments to assess the influence of **page connections** and the **damping factor** on page rankings.

## Key Features

- **Alterations in Page Connections**: Examined how changes in connections between pages impact rankings.
- **Agent-Based Model vs. Real-World Rankings**: Compared ABM results with actual page rankings to assess accuracy.
- **Impact of Damping Factor**: Studied the influence of the damping factor on page rankings and how surfer behavior affects rankings.
